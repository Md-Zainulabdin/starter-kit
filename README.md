# Next.js Starter Kit

This is a starter kit for a Next.js application with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI, Prisma, and NextAuth. It is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for building web applications.

## Project Overview

This starter kit integrates:

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/):** A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
- **[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/):** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **[Shadcn UI](https://shadcn.dev/):** A component library for building consistent and customizable UI components.
- **[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/):** An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for database interaction.
- **[NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/):** Authentication for Next.js applications.

## Installation Process

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/nextjs-starter-kit.git
    cd nextjs-starter-kit
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    # or
    bun install
    ```

3. Run the development server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
    ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/(main)/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
